A modified version of Wayne Truchsess' I2C Master library.
http://dsscircuits.com/articles/arduino-i2c-master-library.html

Two noteworthy changes have been made:
1) This version uses 16-bit addresses instead of 8-bit (thus the modified name)
2) Supports "acknowledge polling", a technique used for the 24XX1025 EEPROM

This isn't intended to be a replacement for his library; on the contrary,
I only expect this to be used with my 24XX1025 EEPROM library.
Still, feel free to use it if you need the modifications.

Needless to say, the LGPL license remains, as changing that isn't up to me.
(AFAIK I have the right to release this under the full GPL, but why the heck
would I make that change?)
