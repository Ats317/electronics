Arduino library for the Microchip MCP49x1 series DACs
Thomas Backman, 2012

Supported models:
* MCP4901 (8-bit)
* MCP4911 (10-bit)
* MCP4921 (12-bit)

This code should be easy to "port" to the MCP4902/MCP4912/MCP4922 dual DACs,
but I don't have any at home and would rather not release fully untested code.

Example usage:

/////////////////////////////////

#include <SPI.h>         // Please don't miss this line
#include <DAC_MCP49x1.h>

DAC_MCP49x1 dac(DAC_MCP49x1::MCP4901, 10, 7); // DAC Model, SS pin, LDAC pin

void setup() {} // No setup code is necessary

void loop() {
    dac.output(255);
    dac.latch(); // this call is only necessary if the LDAC pin isn't tied to ground
    delay(1000);
    
    dac.output(0);
    dac.latch(); // same as above
    delay(1000);
}

Simple function overview:

Constructor (DAC_MCP49x1)
	Takes three arguments: the DAC model (MCP4901, MCP4911 or MCP4921), the chip
	select pin, and the LDAC pin.
	If the LDAC functionality isn't wanted (if you don't know, you likely don't
	want it), pass -1 as the LDAC pin and make sure that pin is tied to ground.

setBuffer(bool)
	Should the DAC buffer the reference voltage?
	Note: if "true", VREF cannot be VDD (e.g. +5 V). Defaults to false.

setGain(int)
	Sets the gain. The output voltage is x/2^n * VREF * gain, where x = the value
	passed to out and n = the number of bits
	For example, for a 8-bit DAC with gain 2x and VREF = 5 V where out(100) is
	called, vout = 100/256 * 5 * 2 = 3.90625 V.
	Only 1 and 2 are valid values!

setSPIDivider(int)
	Sets the SPI clock frequency. See the Arduino docs: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPISetClockDivider
	Uses the same constants (SPI_CLOCK_DIV2 etc.) as in the Arduino docs.

shutdown(void)
	Shuts the DAC down to save power. (~3.5 µA in standby, ~150 µA powered up.)
	Settling time after calling set() increases from ~5 to ~10 µs when in standby.

output(unsigned short)
	Sends the value to the DAC. If the LDAC pin is tied to ground, Vout will change "instantly".
	If the LDAC pin is connected to the Arduino, nothing will change until latch() is called.

latch(void)
	Changes the output voltage based on the last value sent using output().
	Creates a low pulse on the DACs LDAC pin (pin 5 on the DAC chip).
	The LDAC pin can be tied to ground instead, to update automatically ASAP.

setPortWrite(bool)
	Note: PortWrite is not supported on the Arduino Leonardo, but should work on
	the Uno and Mega. (One could change this by changing the ports used in the code.)
	*** The CS and LDAC pins set in the constructor are IGNORED when this is set to true!!! ***

	PortWrite is a method that speeds up the code significantly, but only works on fixed pins (see below).
	It's roughly 30 times faster than digitalWrite in my measurements for this code.
	(That doesn't mean that the entire code is 30 times faster, but changing a pin value is.)

	In order to use the faster method e.g. on the Arduino Uno, you must use pin 7 on the Uno for the LDAC pin, 
	and pin 10 for the CS pin. Anything else won't work. If these pins are busy doing something else, you can't use this speed-up.

	Use these pins:

	For the LDAC pin: PD7 (Uno: digital pin 7, Mega: digital pin 38)
	For the CS pin: PB2 (Uno: digital pin 10, Mega: digital pin 51)

	Also note that since these are fixed, and CS cannot be shared between devices, *you can't use multiple DACs with PortWrite enabled*!

	So, in short...
	Pro: much faster (only matters for relatively high-frequency stuff;
	the difference is on the order of a few microseconds)
	Cons: only works on fixed pins, only works with 1 DAC, doesn't work on all Arduinos
